## 🔄 Approval Workflow

### Normal Swap Flow
```
1. Employee A requests swap with Employee B
   ↓ Status: pending_target
2. Employee B accepts
   ↓ Status: pending_manager
3. Manager approves
   ↓ Status: approved → completed
4. Schedule updated automatically
```

### Cross-Department Swap Flow
```
1. Employee A (IT) requests swap with Employee B (Sales)
   ↓ Status: pending_target
   ↓ System detects cross-department
2. Employee B accepts
   ↓ Status: pending_manager
3. Manager approves
   ↓ Status: pending_hr
4. HR approves
   ↓ Status: approved → completed
5. Schedule updated automatically
```

### Emergency Swap Flow
```
1. Employee A (sick) requests emergency coverage
   ↓ Expires in 2 hours (vs 24h for normal)
   ↓ Status: pending_target
2. Employee B accepts (gets 2x overtime)
   ↓ Status: pending_manager
3. Manager quick-approves
   ↓ Status: approved → completed
4. Schedule updated
5. Compensation recorded
```

## 📋 Swap Types

### 1. Direct Swap
Both employees exchange shifts completely.
```
John (Mon Morning) ↔️ Jane (Mon Afternoon)
Result: John works Afternoon, Jane works Morning
```

### 2. One-Way Coverage
One employee covers another's shift.
```
Bob → Alice covers Bob's night shift
Result: Alice works extra shift, Bob gets day off
Compensation: Overtime pay
```

### 3. Temporary Coverage
Short-term coverage for specific date.
```
Sarah → Mike covers one shift
Result: Mike works Sarah's shift once
```

### 4. Emergency Swap
Urgent swap (sick, family emergency).
```
John (sick) → Emergency coverage requested
Fast-track approval: 2 hours expiry
Higher compensation: 2x rate
```

### 5. Partial Swap
Only part of a shift swapped.
```
Alice (8am-5pm) → Bob covers 8am-12pm only
Result: Bob works 8-12, Alice works 12-5
Pro-rated hours
```

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Smart Validation
- ❌ Cannot swap to empty shift (must have replacement)
- ❌ Cannot cancel within 24 hours of shift
- ❌ Cannot respond after expiration
- ✅ Auto-detect cross-department swaps
- ✅ Auto-calculate compensation
- ✅ Validate user permissions

### ✅ Approval Logic
- Target must approve first
- Manager approves after target
- HR approval for cross-department only
- Emergency swaps fast-tracked
- Admin can approve any stage

### ✅ Audit Trail
Every action logged in `shift_swap_history`:
- Request created
- Target accepted/rejected
- Manager approved/rejected
- HR approved/rejected
- Request cancelled
- Swap completed

### ✅ User Experience
- Real-time status updates
- Clear status indicators
- Approval progress display
- Rejection reasons shown
- Expiration countdown
- Emergency badge for urgent swaps

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Run migration on Supabase
- [ ] Verify all tables created
- [ ] Seed default shifts and break policies
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Test UI flows
- [ ] Add Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Configure notifications (email/push)
- [ ] Add real schedule update logic in `executeShiftSwap()`

### RLS Policies Needed
```sql
-- Users can view swaps they're involved in
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own swaps" ON shift_swap_requests
  FOR SELECT USING (
    requestor_id = auth.uid() OR 
    target_id = auth.uid()
  );

-- Users can create swap requests
CREATE POLICY "Users can create swaps" ON shift_swap_requests
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (requestor_id = auth.uid());

-- Targets can respond
CREATE POLICY "Targets can respond" ON shift_swap_requests
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    target_id = auth.uid() AND 
    status = 'pending_target'
  );

-- Managers can approve
CREATE POLICY "Managers can approve" ON shift_swap_requests
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    manager_id = auth.uid() AND 
    status IN ('pending_manager', 'pending_hr')
  );
```

### Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Shift Swap Settings
SWAP_EXPIRY_HOURS_NORMAL=24
SWAP_EXPIRY_HOURS_EMERGENCY=2
SWAP_CANCEL_HOURS_BEFORE=24
ENABLE_CROSS_DEPT_SWAPS=true
REQUIRE_HR_FOR_CROSS_DEPT=true
```

## 📊 Database Statistics

**Tables:** 7 main tables
**Indexes:** 15 indexes for performance
**Triggers:** 5 auto-update triggers
**Constraints:** 3 check constraints
**Relations:** 12 foreign keys

**Storage Estimates:**

4. **Manager Dashboard**
   - Pending approvals count
   - Quick approve/reject
   - Bulk actions
   - Team schedule overview

5. **Analytics**
   - Swap frequency by employee
   - Most common swap reasons
   - Average approval time

8. Verify fast execution
```

### Test Case 3: Rejection Flow
```
