## General Questions

### Q: What is the Attendance System?
A: The Attendance System is a modern attendance management solution that allows you to track your work hours using face recognition, manual check-ins, and works both online and offline.

### Q: Do I need to install any software?
A: No installation is required for desktop use. Simply access the system through your web browser. For mobile devices, you can install the Progressive Web App (PWA) for a better experience.

### Q: What browsers are supported?
A: We support the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. For the best experience, we recommend using Chrome.

### Q: Is there a mobile app?
A: Yes! While there's no native app, you can install our PWA on your mobile device:

### Q: Can I access the system from multiple devices?
A: Yes, you can use the system on any device with a web browser. Your data syncs across all devices when you're online.

## Face Recognition

### Q: How does face recognition work?
A: The system uses advanced facial recognition algorithms to create a unique mathematical representation of your face. This data is encrypted and stored securely.

### Q: Is my face data secure?
A: Absolutely. Your face data is encrypted at rest and in transit, and is never shared with third parties. Only you and authorized administrators can access it.

### Q: What if face recognition doesn't work for me?
A: You can always use manual check-in/check-out as an alternative. You can also try re-enrolling your face or improving lighting conditions.

### Q: Can I use face recognition with glasses?
A: Yes, but for best results, you may want to enroll your face both with and without glasses, or use consistent lighting.

### Q: How do I re-enroll my face?
A: Go to Profile → Face Recognition → "Enroll New Face" and follow the instructions. You can have multiple face profiles.

### Q: What happens if my appearance changes?
A: If face recognition starts failing, simply re-enroll your face with your current appearance. You can keep multiple profiles if needed.

## Attendance Tracking

A: You have several options:
- Click "Check In/Out" on the dashboard

A: All your data is stored securely on your device and encrypted. When you reconnect, it automatically syncs with the server.
