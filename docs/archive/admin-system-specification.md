### 5.2 Database Operations

#### Employee Management Queries
```sql
-- Employee listing with filtering
SELECT u.*, d.name as department_name, p.name as position_name
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN departments d ON u.department_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN positions p ON u.position_id = p.id
WHERE u.role IN ('employee', 'admin', 'hr', 'manager')
  AND ($1::text IS NULL OR u.name ILIKE '%' || $1 || '%')
  AND ($2::text IS NULL OR u.department_id = $2)
  AND ($3::text IS NULL OR u.role = $3)
ORDER BY u.name
LIMIT $4 OFFSET $5;

-- Employee statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_employees,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_employees,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'inactive' THEN 1 END) as inactive_employees,
  department_id,
  d.name as department_name
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN departments d ON u.department_id = d.id
GROUP BY department_id, d.name;
```

#### Attendance Management Queries
```sql
-- Attendance records with filtering
SELECT ar.*, u.name as employee_name, u.email, d.name as department_name
FROM attendance_records ar
JOIN users u ON ar.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN departments d ON u.department_id = d.id
WHERE ($1::date IS NULL OR ar.date >= $1)
  AND ($2::date IS NULL OR ar.date <= $2)
  AND ($3::uuid IS NULL OR ar.user_id = $3)
  AND ($4::text IS NULL OR ar.status = $4)
ORDER BY ar.date DESC, ar.check_in DESC
LIMIT $5 OFFSET $6;

-- Attendance statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'present' THEN 1 END) as present_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'absent' THEN 1 END) as absent_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'late' THEN 1 END) as late_count,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (check_out - check_in))/3600) as avg_hours
FROM attendance_records
WHERE date BETWEEN $1 AND $2;
```

### 5.3 Caching Strategies

#### Redis Cache Implementation
```typescript
// Cache keys structure
const CACHE_KEYS = {
  DASHBOARD_STATS: 'admin:dashboard:stats',
  EMPLOYEE_LIST: 'admin:employees:list',
  ATTENDANCE_STATS: 'admin:attendance:stats',
  SYSTEM_HEALTH: 'admin:system:health',
  USER_SESSIONS: 'admin:sessions:',
};

// Cache TTL configuration
const CACHE_TTL = {
  DASHBOARD_STATS: 300,      // 5 minutes
  EMPLOYEE_LIST: 1800,       // 30 minutes
  ATTENDANCE_STATS: 600,     // 10 minutes
  SYSTEM_HEALTH: 60,         // 1 minute
  USER_SESSIONS: 3600,       // 1 hour
};
```

#### Cache Invalidation Strategy
- **Time-based**: Automatic expiration based on TTL
- **Event-based**: Invalidate on data changes
- **Manual**: Admin-triggered cache refresh
- **Selective**: Invalidate only affected cache entries

### 5.4 Performance Considerations

#### Database Optimization
- **Indexing Strategy**: Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient queries with proper joins and filtering
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connection pool management
- **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas for reporting queries

#### Frontend Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy load admin components
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large data tables
- **Debouncing**: For search and filter inputs
- **Memoization**: Cache computed values and API responses

#### API Performance
- **Pagination**: Implement efficient pagination
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
- **Compression**: Gzip response compression
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery via CDN

### 5.5 Security Measures

#### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// Role-based access control middleware
const requireRole = (roles: UserRole[]) => {
  return async (req: NextRequest) => {
    const token = req.headers.get('authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
    if (!token) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
    }
    
    const user = await verifyToken(token);
    if (!user || !roles.includes(user.role)) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 });
    }
    
    return null; // Continue to next handler
  };
};
```

#### Data Validation & Sanitization
- **Input Validation**: Use Zod schemas for all inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user inputs
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens

#### Audit Logging
```typescript
// Audit log structure
interface AuditLog {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  action: string;
  resource: string;
  resourceId?: string;
  oldValues?: any;
  newValues?: any;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

#### Data Encryption
- **Data at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data in database
- **Data in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS encryption
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt
- **API Keys**: Encrypted storage of API keys
