## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Architecture
```
PostgreSQL (Supabase)
├── users (with RLS)
├── attendance_records (with RLS)
├── schedules (with RLS)
├── schedule_assignments (with RLS)
├── face_embeddings (with RLS)
├── settings (admin-only access)
├── audit_logs (automatic logging)
├── notifications (user-specific)
└── reports (saved reports)
```

### Authentication Flow
```
Request → Extract JWT → Verify Token → Check User Active → 
Check Role → Attach User to Request → Log Audit → Handle Request
```

### Face Recognition Flow
```
Camera → Capture → face-api.js → Extract Descriptor (128D) → 
Send to API → Match Against DB → Calculate Confidence → 
Accept/Reject → Create Attendance Record
```

### Report Generation Flow
```
Config → Validate → Fetch Data → Filter → Group → Aggregate → 
Format (PDF/Excel/CSV/JSON) → Add Metadata → Return File
```
