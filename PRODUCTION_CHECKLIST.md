## ⚠️ Critical Security Reminders

### NEVER
- ❌ Commit `.env` files to git
- ❌ Expose service role keys in client code
- ❌ Use default passwords in production
- ❌ Disable security checks (ignoreBuildErrors, ignoreDuringBuilds)
- ❌ Use wildcard CORS (`*`)
- ❌ Log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, API keys)

### ALWAYS
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Enable HTTPS
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Validate all user input
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Have a backup and recovery plan
