# 🎯 ANALISA MENDALAM: Face Enrollment UX Problems

## 📊 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Existing Enrollment Flow (Admin):
```
1. Admin → Employees Page
2. Find employee in table (may need pagination/search)
3. Click Actions → "Enroll Face" (camera icon)
4. Modal opens with camera
5. Admin must position employee in front of camera
6. Must capture 3 samples manually (one by one)
7. Each sample: position → wait → capture → repeat
8. If any sample fails → start over
9. Close modal
10. Done (1 employee enrolled)
```

**Time per employee:** 2-5 minutes  
**For 50 employees:** 100-250 minutes (~2-4 hours!)
